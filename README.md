This program reads given details such as functions, range, iterations, and initial point as well as matrices. Then uses methods given below:

Two methods when given functions, range, interations, initial point:

Euler Method

Runge-Kutta Method

For the matrices:

Gaussian Elimination & Backword Elimination

LU Factorization

Cofactor Expansion & Eigenvalues
